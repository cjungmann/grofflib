.SS MACRO cdef_arg
.PP
Use this macro to declare each member of the function or other
declaration.
.PP
.gp_cdef_arg
.IP
The first parameters to
.B cdef_arg
are the
.IR type ,
which includes the data type and any modifiers, followed by the
.I name
of the parameter.
The
.I name
parameter may be omitted for declarations like an enum.
.IP
The optional parameter,
.BR last ,
is not evaluated by value, just by inclusion, and it indicates that
the argument should not use the terminator character defined in the
.B cdef_start
macro.
Use this to prevent a comma from following the last parameter in
a function prototype.
.IP
If specifying the
.B last
parameter, be sure a value is also entered for the
.B name
parameter, even if it is only an empty string, as would be the case
for an enum.
