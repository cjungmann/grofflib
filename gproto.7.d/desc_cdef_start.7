.so fork.tmac
.SS MACRO cdef_start
.PP
Use this macro to begin defining a prototype.
The optional arguments have default values that work for function
definitions, but they can be replaced for other types of
declarations.
.PP
.gp_cdef_start
.TP
.I type
is the return type or data type being defined.
Prevent unexpected line breaks by using non-breaking spaces
within this argument, or putting some keywords in a line before
the
.B cdef_start
macro.
.TP
.I name
is the name of the item being declared.
.TP
.I enclosures
is an optional two-character string that overrides the default
value of
.RB \(lq () \(rq.
The characters are used to start and end the argument list.
Structs and enums will set the argument to
.RB \(lq {} \(rq.
.TP
.I terminator
is the character that will mark the end of each argument.
The default value is
.RB \(lq , \(rq
as would be used for a function.
The other common terminator character is
.RB \(lq ; \(rq.
.IP
The
.I terminator
character also determines when the terminator is used.
Parameters of a function declaration are separated by commas, and
no terminator comes between the last parameter and the closing
enclosure character.
This arrangement also applies to enums, whose members are
also separated by commas.
.IP
The members of a struct are terminated by a semicolon
.RB \(lq ; \(dq,
even the final member.
