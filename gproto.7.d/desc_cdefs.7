.SS CDEF MACROS OVERVIEW
.PP
This set of macros produces C-style function prototypes for man pages.
With small tweaks, the macros are also suitable for declaring
.IR structs " and " enums " along with " functions ,
as well as
.I typedefs
of any of the above.
.PP
For convenience, this document will refer to the C declarations as
.IR prototypes ,
as they are meant to reside in the SYNOPSIS section.
.PP
The process for entering a prototype is:
